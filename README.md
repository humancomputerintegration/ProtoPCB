# ProtoPCB
![project overview figure](./Images/Figure1.png)

This repository contains our tests, evaluation files, and software tool (ProtoPCB) presented in the paper "ProtoPCB: Reclaiming Printed Circuit Board E-waste as Prototyping Material", which will appear at CHI2025. This tool was built by Jasmine Lu (@xjasminelu), Sai Rishitha Boddu (@rishiboddu) with project assistance from Pedro Lopes at the University of Chicago's [Human Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org).

## ProtoPCB Software 
ProtoPCB is a python-based tool that builds off of [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) command line tools, [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [CairoSVG](https://cairosvg.org/), and [pcb-tools](https://github.com/curtacircuitos/pcb-tools). It is designed to support analyzing PCB Boards to identify ways they can be reused to implement new circuits. It does so by taking an input schematic and using computer vision to scan boards for their solder pads, conducting traces, and vias in order to map out the relevant connections of the board. Using this mapping, it analyzes all the methods that can be used to implement a circuit (positions to place a component, wires to add, traces to cut, etc.).

## Repository Organization
### Code
Code is organized in the code directory. This includes ProtoPCB's base code (scripts, GUI, test suite). You can use this to run technical evaluations (via scripts in tests.py).

### Evaluation Files
All files and data for the Technical Evaluation (PCB boards) can be found in the [Evaluation Files](./Evaluation Files) directory

### Installation
To use ProtoPCB, you must have installed KiCad and Python3 on your machine. The system was built primarily with Mac OS. It has not been tested yet on Windows so some elements may not port over well. If you're interested in collaborating on a Windows version, please reach out!

Detailed instructions can be found on the page [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)

## Contributing
### Submitting issues
As this tool was born out of a research project, it is a _prototype_. However, we'd love to hear about any bugs you might encounter during use of our tool. We encourage you to submit any issues that arise and we'll do our best to get around to them. Please note that there is only one (very busy) PhD student who will be able to provide support, so please extend us grace with any issues you encounter!
